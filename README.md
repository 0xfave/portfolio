## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) - JS library for component swipe
- [mixitup.js](https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/) - JS library
- [Scrollreveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I have plans to create this portfolio with next.js.
